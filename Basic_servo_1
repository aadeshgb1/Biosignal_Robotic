/*
*A servo is very useful in many projects!
*A Servo is a small device that has an output shaft. 
*This shaft can be positioned to specific angular positions by sending the servo a coded signal. 
*That's why we need the Arduino, in oder to send that signal to the servo. 
*Servos in general require a lot of current to operate since they have a motor inside. 
*If you only need to control one small servo like this one you can connect it directly to Arduino. 
*If you need to control two or more servos you need an external power supply or battery pack.
